# RandomSoundBot
 Discord bot that joins channels at randoms times and plays random sounds

Everything relevant is in the "Assets" folder

RandomSoundBot.py is the source code

If you want to get the bot to work on your own end, you need to make your own bot and put its token in a file called "BotToken.txt" in the same folder as the source code file (Assets/BotToken.txt)

The "Sounds" folder is where you put sounds for the bot to use

Please make sure they are only .mp3 and .wav files, otherwise it will not detect them
